Bring your operational skills to bear, not merely following the playbook, but improving it.\n\nWhat You Won\u2019t Be Doing\n\nYou will not be doing sales and marketing. Your job is to transform the operations, enabling the CEO to focus on go-to-market.\n\nYou will not be doing HR and administrative management. We have systematized the work activities of every role, so you can focus on the execution of your transformations.
